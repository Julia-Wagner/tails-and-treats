### **Wireframes**

I created wireframes to visualize my ideas using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). While creating the mobile wireframes, I realized I was not sure how to let the users control the character without a keyboard. At first I thought I would use touch controls. But after doing some research and playing other maze games on my phone, I realized that was not the best user experience. So I decided to add control buttons to play the game on a phone as shown in my mobile wireframe.
