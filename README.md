### **Wireframes**

I created wireframes to visualize my ideas using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). While creating the mobile wireframes, I realized I was not sure how to let the users control the character without a keyboard. At first I thought I would use touch controls. But after doing some research and playing other maze games on my phone, I realized that was not the best user experience. So I decided to add control buttons to play the game on a phone as shown in my mobile wireframe.

### **Color Scheme**

To create the color scheme I started by looking for icons I could use as dog characters and treats. I picked out the main colors used for these icons and used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23F1F1F2%0D%0A%23312A28%0D%0A%23A26938%0D%0A%23EEE6D9%0D%0A%236A574A%0D%0A%23FCCD99%0D%0A%230c6d92%0D%0A%2366802B%0D%0A%23FF6431%0D%0A%0D%0A%23FFCF5F%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.

### **Fonts**

I decided to use **Shrikhand** for my headings and **Montserrat** for my text. These two fonts seem to pair nicely and I like the bold and playful shape of Shrikhand for the topic of a dog-themed game.

### **Dog Characters and Treats**

I wanted to make the game customizable by letting the users decide which dog they want to navigate through the maze. For this I chose the following five dogs.

I also looked for icons I could use as treats to scatter throughout the maze.

## **Features**

### **Header**

![Desktop header](docs/screenshots/header_desktop.png)

The header contains a heading, subheading and navigation. The navigation is hidden when the user first opens the website. It contains two elements, but only shows one at a time, if any. Once the user starts game, the header navigation shows a button to open the menu. When the menu is open, after a game has been started, the navigation shows a button to go back to the game. If no game has been started yet, the navigation is hidden.

At the bottom of the footer, I have the copyright information.
